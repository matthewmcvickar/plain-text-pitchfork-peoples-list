# Plain-text Pitchfork People’s List

[matthewmcvickar.github.io/plain-text-pitchfork-peoples-list](http://matthewmcvickar.github.io/plain-text-pitchfork-peoples-list/)

In 2012, Pitchfork built a tool for readers to make their personal 100 best albums of 1996–2011 (the years that Pitchfork had so far been around). (The tool is no longer available, but [the results](http://pitchfork.com/peopleslist/) are.)

This tool was built to help me put my album list in order. You could select the entire page of albums, copy and paste into a textbox, and end up with just a list of albums without the clutter and text of the rest of the page. You could then use a text editor to put your list in order and then use that as a guide to order your albums.

A very, very niche tool.
